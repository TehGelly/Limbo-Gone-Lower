The remaining files are split into two categories in the UNKNOWN folder:
- UNKNOWN_FXS are implied to be OpenGL .fx files. While names can be retrieved from some of them, paths are not known, and, therefore, the CRCs do not line up.
- UNKNOWN_PNGS are pngs that have paths within them that do not resolve to CRCs seen in the pkg files.
-- Some of the PNGs are in a **system** directory and are small icons, while the rest are localizations about connecting to Xbox Live.
